# ARFoundationMVP
A MVP Project to apply all lessons learned through [Learn XR](https://www.learnxr.io) AR Course.

**Note:** the plan is to include a variety of small AR simulations or games and this repo will keep growing as new experiences are developed.

* Current MVP Project: Helicopter AR Simulation!
